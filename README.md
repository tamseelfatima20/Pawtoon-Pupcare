<p>Pawtoon is here to ensure that every street dog has access to the food they need to thrive. Collecting donations for dog food and distributing them to areas where these pups are most in need & spreading love one meal at a time.</p>

<b>I created the app snapshots, logo and the hero image using canva.</b>

<ul>
  <li>Images are taken from Istock website.</li>
  <li>Used tints and Shades website to extract the shades of the brand color.</li>
  <li>Coolers website is used to check the contrast of different shades.</li>
  <li>Ionicons for different icons used in the website.</li>
</ul>
